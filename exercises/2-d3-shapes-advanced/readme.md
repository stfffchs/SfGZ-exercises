# Rendering advanced shapes with d3

Try rendering a `<path />` with d3 by passing the formatted string to the ‘d’ prop. If you are more comfortable in javascript, you can also use the `d3.path()` utility. That way you do not have to write a string of cryptic short-hand characters.

### Getting started

To get started with this exercise clone this repo, and navigate into the `/exercises/2-d3-shapes-basic` directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zcreativelabs/SfGZ-exercises.git
cd SfGZ-exercises/exercises/2-d3-shapes-advanced
```

Once in the directory install the dependencies and start the server.

```bash
npm install
...
npm start
```

The main file of interest for you is the `visualization.js` file. Each example has a certain amount of boilerplate to help you along.

### Task

Your task in this exercise is to render a `path` shape based on the `shapePath` variable provided.
